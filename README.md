I am currently working on my own projects, which you can see in my repos in my GitHub profile.
At the moment I am developing my C++ programming skills using STL, Qt libraries, but also trying
to practice my JavaScript skills (including Node.JS). My main project is [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbytegear/BinOM/page/src/img/BinOM.ico" height="20px">BinOM](https://github.com/gbytegear/BinOM),
a hierarchical data serialization / deserialization format implemented as a C++ library and helper
applications for data editing. The goal of this project is to implement a simple and optimized way
of storing and transferring hierarchical data containing both primitive variables and strings or
entire files. In the future, it is planned to implement a full-fledged hierarchical database based
on this format, but some developments are already available now.
