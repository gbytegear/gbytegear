#  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gbytegear
## Few about me...
At the moment, programming is my hobby, and I work on my own projects,
which you can see in my repositories in this GitHub profile. Initially,
I programmed in JavaScript, but in 2019 I switched to C++ and QT. At the moment,
I am developing my skills in programming in pure C++ with STL, FreeGLUT or SDL2 libraries,
but I also try to practice my skills in QT and JavaScript.

* C++ (17)
  * Compiler: GCC/MinGw
  * Build system: Make
  * Basics
  * OOP
  * RAII
  * Metaprogramming (templates)
  * STL Containers
  * Iterators

    * Mutual exclusion
