#### ℹ️ Few about me...
At the moment, programming is my hobby, and I work on my own projects,
which you can see in my repositories in this GitHub profile. Initially,
I programmed in JavaScript, but in 2019 I switched to C++ and QT. At the moment,
I am developing my skills in programming in pure C++ with STL, Boost, FreeGLUT or SDL2
libraries, but I also try to practice my skills in QT and JavaScript.
