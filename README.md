At the moment, programming is my hobby, and I work on my own projects, which you can see in my repositories in this GitHub profile. Initially, I programmed in JavaScript, but in 2019 I switched to C++ and QT. At the moment, I am developing my skills in programming in C++ with STL, OpenSSL, Qt or other libraries, but I also try to practice my skills in JavaScript.

#### üóÉÔ∏è My current project:
I am currently working on a [LibreHub](https://github.com/gbytegear/LibreHub) project - [federated social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network), based on my [BinOM](https://github.com/gbytegear/BinOM) and [TcpServer](https://github.com/gbytegear/TcpServer) projects, and provided end-to-end encryption based on [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) and [AES 256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) algorithms with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library. The social network client GUI is developing using [Qt Quick](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-index.html). This project is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). The motto of this project: _**Let's make social communications open and confidential, without third parties.**_
